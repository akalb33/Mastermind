# Mastermind
By Andrew Kalb

One of my earlier projects using the "game frame" I developed with my father. 

This game is a digital version of the board game Mastermind. 

This game has 1 player modes for both color and word games, in which the hidden sequence is generated randomly or from a list of words. 

Pieces are dragged from the tray and placed starting at the bottom of the game board. Pieces already used to guess previously can be duplicated if clicked and dragged from.

In the 2 player mode, somebody is able to set the pattern and press the button before the game initiates for the second player.

How to run this game:
 - Download the "Mastermind Remastered" folder and run the "Mastermind Remastered.exe" inside of it.
