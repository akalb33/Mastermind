# Mastermind
By Andrew Kalb

One of my earlier projects using the "game frame" I developed with my father. 
This game is a digital version of the board game Mastermind. 
This game has 1 player modes for both color and word games, in which the hidden sequence is generated randomly or from a list of words. 
In the 2 player mode, somebody is able to set the pattern and press the button before the game initiates for the second player.
